bash:

these are simple bash scripts that I use to convert files for tuxracer.

autoconv.sh : file that automates tcltotux, tcltotux has to be in your PATH.

conv.sh : converts SGI .rgb files to .png files. requires imagemagick's convert to be in your path.

dirgen.sh : scans all directories in a group and adds entries for them into courses.lst.
